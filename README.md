## Live Server Setup Steps

To enable live updates in the browser as you practice JavaScript, the following steps were taken:

1. **Created `index.html`:**
   - A starter HTML file was added as the main entry point for your practice.
2. **Installed `live-server`:**
   - Ran `npm install -g live-server` to install the live-reloading development server globally.
3. **Started the Live Server:**
   - Used `npx live-server --port=5500 --no-browser` to start the server on port 5500.
   - Open [http://localhost:5500](http://localhost:5500) in your browser to view your site. The page will auto-refresh on file changes.
